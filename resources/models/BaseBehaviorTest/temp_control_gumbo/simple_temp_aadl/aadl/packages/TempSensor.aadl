--
--   The TempSensor package structure reflects a multi-vendor workflow/distribution concept
--   in which a manufacture provides model and software drivers for their hardware component(s).
--
--   For simplicity, the sensor hardware is not modeled in this tutorial example.  Thus, only
--   a thread corresponding to the driver and data types of info coming from the driver are modeled.
